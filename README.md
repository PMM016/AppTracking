# Snake Game (Pygame)

A polished, fully playable Snake game built with Pygame.

## Run the game

```bash
python snake_game.py
```

If you don't have Pygame installed:

```bash
python -m pip install pygame
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo ships a GitHub Actions workflow that packages the game for the web using `pygbag` and deploys it to GitHub Pages.

1. Push to the `main`, `master`, or `work` branch.
2. Enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings and select the `gh-pages` branch.
3. After the workflow finishes, your playable build will be available at the Pages URL.
